pomodoro
========

A pomodoro timer I created while I was procrastinating. Ironically enough, this was a way of procrastinating that helped my productivity later.

The Sounds
===========
Both effects (`AirHorn.wav` and `MetalGong.wav`) were made by Mike Koenig and uploaded to soundbible.com under a CC Attribution 3.0 License. You can get them http://soundbible.com/128-Metal-Gong.html and http://soundbible.com/1542-Air-Horn.html

I got the code for playing the sounds in question from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/307305/play-a-sound-with-python.
