pomodoro
========

A pomodoro timer I created while I was procrastinating. Ironically enough, this was a way of procrastinating that helped my productivity later.

The Sounds
===========
Both effects (`AirHorn.wav` and `MetalGong.wav`) were made by Mike Koenig and uploaded to soundbible.com under a CC Attribution 3.0 License. You can get them [here](http://soundbible.com/128-Metal-Gong.html) and [here](http://soundbible.com/1542-Air-Horn.html)

I got the code for playing the sounds in question from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/307305/play-a-sound-with-python.

Acknowledgements
================
Thanks to SO user [roippi](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2581969/roippi) for helping me debug my script. I had a problem with it having an error after looping once.
